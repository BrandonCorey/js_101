// One day, Spot was playing with the Munster family's home computer, 
// and he wrote a small program to mess with their demographic data:

let munsters = {
  Herman: { age: 32, gender: "male" },
  Lily: { age: 30, gender: "female" },
  Grandpa: { age: 402, gender: "male" },
  Eddie: { age: 10, gender: "male" },
  Marilyn: { age: 23, gender: "female" }
};

function messWithDemographics(demoObject) {
  Object.values(demoObject).forEach(familyMember => {
    familyMember["age"] += 42;
    familyMember["gender"] = "other";
  });
}

messWithDemographics(munsters);
console.log(munsters);

// I believe that this will indeed mess all of the ages and genders
// Objects are pass by reference, so the original values are getting messed here
// (A copy of the reference is being passed to demoObject I believe)
// I was right --
